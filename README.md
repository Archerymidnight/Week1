Epsilon Tauri b (abbreviated ε Tauri b or ε Tau b), formally named Amateru /æməˈtɛruː/, is a super-Jupiter exoplanet orbiting the K-type giant star Epsilon Tauri approximately 155 light-years (47.53 parsecs, or nearly 1.466×1015 km) away from the Earth in the constellation of Taurus.[1] It orbits the star further out than Earth orbits the Sun. It has moderate eccentricity.[2]

The planet orbits one of the four giant stars in the Hyades cluster that is 2.7 times the mass of our Sun, making it the most massive planet-harboring star. This provides evidence that it was an A-type star when it was on the main-sequence.
